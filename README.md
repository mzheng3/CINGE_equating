## Bootstrap Equating Errors for the Common-item Nonequivalent Groups Design: A Comparison of Rasch Equating Methods

The current study extended the research of Tsai, Hanson, Kolen, and Forsyth (2001)  by 
comparing bootstrap equating errors using four Rasch IRT equating methods for the CINEG design: 
(a) whether Rasch IRT parameters are estimated separately or concurrently, 
(b) whether a scale transformation is calculated to place parameters for the two forms on a common scale (e.g., Stocking & Lord, 1983), 
(c) whether the true-score or observed-score equating method is used. The sizes of the equating anchor were examined in all four different methods.
